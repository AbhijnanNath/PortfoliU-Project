# Mission:

*By creating a free open-source repository with all the resources, documentation, and information needed to help students create their own portfolio webpage, we will be giving students from CSU and beyond the ability to showcase their skills in a meaningful way. By working on this project, members of this team will be able to develop their own portfolio website and gain experience in creating and managing a project with a real-world impact.*

*Many companies in the software and information system industries are more likely to interview individuals with personal websites. Having a personal portfolio website allows for an individual to present information to a potential employer that would otherwise go unknown. From detailed information about projects or accomplishments to fun personal information, a portfolio website is a great way to convey who you are apart from your resume.*

# Justification for creating the PorfoliU Project:

There are many students and incoming people entering the software and information systems business industries. Several companies look for and are more likely to interview individuals with personal websites and developed projects. Because these individuals are entering these industries with limited knowledge, they commonly lack the resources and information to do so.

# Project Goals:

- [x] Develop/acquire the source code for simple personal website portfolios
- [x] Create tutorial documentation to aid users through the process of creating their site
- [x] Provide resources for users on how to build, maintain and individualize their site
- [ ] Open the repository to the public
