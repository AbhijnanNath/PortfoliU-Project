## Step by step guide to build a free website with WordPress

### 1. Signup to WordPress.com

Creating a WordPress.com account. You can start your site for free and then decide if you’d like to upgrade to use any of the advanced features.

### 2. Activate the portfolio feature.

Some themes will have the portfolio feature already active, but if yours doesn’t, follow these directions: 

    Go to My Sites > Manage > Settings > Writing > Content Types. 
    
Turn on the Portfolio Projects option. Your changes should save automatically.

### 3. Set the number of portfolio projects to display per page.

You can control how many of your own portfolio projects show up on each page. In the Content Types menu (that you arrived at in step 1), enter the display number under Portfolio Projects.

*Note that certain themes will override this setting for design purposes and/or have a portfolio grid to display your projects.*

### 4. Consider using a WordPress.com theme designed for portfolios.

While every WordPress.com theme can be used along with an online portfolio, some themes are better suited to portfolios than others. They often have specific designs for project archives and shortcodes, and some of them include page templates specifically for portfolios.

    The most popular portfolio-friendly themes are:

    Argent
    Blask
    Espied
    Illustratr
    Orvis
    Rebalance
    Sidespied
    Sketch


You don’t need to know about web design to use WordPress.com at all, but if you opt for a theme that’s already optimized for a portfolio, your job of putting it together will be even easier. Also, no matter what type of theme you choose, know that just about every modern theme for WordPress.com is fully responsive, meaning it can be easily viewed on mobile devices.

### 5. Add and manage your portfolio projects.

By navigating to the portfolio menu option in the left sidebar (Site > Portfolio), you can access a page that lets you add and manage any projects you want to add to your free portfolio website.

Click the Add New Project button.

A blank page will come up, which looks similar to when you create a new post or page in WordPress.com. This is where you’ll add your project and all related information, like project tags and type, featured image and excerpt.

When adding projects to your online portfolio, keep in mind that they’ll appear in the order they were created, and the most recent addition will show up first. You may want to storyboard your projects on paper before adding them to your online portfolio so you’re sure they appear in the correct order.

On this page, you’ll also notice a Discussion tab on the bottom-right. Here, you can opt to allow comments from visitors.

### 6. Viewing your portfolio projects after adding them.

Once you’ve added projects to your free portfolio website, you can view how they look by using the links that WordPress.com automatically creates. In the links below, replace the words in bold with your information, like your URL or the correct slug.

      View your online portfolio archive: http://yoursite.wordpress.com/portfolio/
      View a project page: http://yoursite.wordpress.com/portfolio/project-slug/
      View the archive for a project type: http://yoursite.wordpress.com/project-type/project-type-slug/
      View the archive for a project tag: http://yoursite.wordpress.com/project-tag/project-tag-slug/

### 7. Add online portfolio projects to your website’s pages or posts.

Shortcodes allow you to embed specific portfolio projects in your WordPress.com pages or posts. You’ll add a shortcode block where you want to embed the project and then choose and customize the appropriate shortcode from the list on this page. The attributes you decide to use will affect how the project is displayed.

Let’s say you’re a photographer, and you want to showcase your best work. Here’s what to do.

### Choose a WordPress.com theme that’s ideal for a photography portfolio.

> Blask, Orvis and Sidespied are especially good for a photography portfolio or designer portfolio, and Illustratr and Rebalance are worth considering if you want to add text descriptions. Since your portfolio is highly visual, you may also want to consider a full-screen theme to put your graphic or photography work front and  center. Or, look for a theme that easily integrates slideshows so you can add all of your best work in a digestible format.

### Check and update your portfolio settings.

    Go to My Sites > Manage > Settings > Writing > Content Types, and turn on the Portfolio Projects option to enable the portfolio feature. 

While on this page, also decide how many projects you want to fit on one page of your photography portfolio. (It’s possible that your theme won’t have this option because it automatically lays out your projects based on its own design.)

### Add your photos to your portfolio.

    Go to Site > Portfolio > Add New Project to start adding images to your online portfolio. 

If you want your portfolio to have images only, leave out the excerpt and description. If you want your images to be explained with text, fill out those fields. Add project tags and types so that your photos are organized how you like. Then, using the portfolio URLs listed in step 5, view the different online portfolio pages to make sure they look how you want them to.
