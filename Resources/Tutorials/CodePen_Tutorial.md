### 4. Pick a template for your website

There are many templates to choose from for your website. You can find your template in the GitHub repository, on "Find a Free and Open-Source Portfolio Template" . There are two folders with templates. There are simple themes and complex themes. For this tutorial we will pick the template "Clean-Minimal". 

This can be found in Templates > Simple Themes > Clean-Minimal.
