# Accessibility with respect to color

## Why should you care?

Everybody uses the internet and each of them are different! It's unlikely that you will know every user so creating a website that some can't use is annoying to them and detrimental to your websites growth. Having more users helps expand the site's reach and increases the likelyhood of gaining more users in the future.

## Who does this affect?

The short answer is everybody! Ensuring that colors are easy to see and read is important for everyone but especially people who have color blindness or other impairments.

## What is color blindess?

Color blindness is a medical condition where an individual can't see colors in a normal way. However, there are a few different forms of color blindness. The most common version of color blindness is the inability to distinguish between different shades of red and green. Another type of color blindness has difficulty between blue and yellow, and a third type of color blindness leaves the individual with no color perception -- everything they see is in greyscale. 
This condition is passed genetically, but it can also develop from traumatic injury to your eyes or brain.

## How to be proactive and work towards a more accesible web
Designing for accessibility doesn’t mean that the aesthetic integrity of your design needs to suffer. With that in mind, here are the top five elements that should be focused on for a colorblind-friendly UX:
  • Use both colors and symbols
  • Keep it minimal
  • Use patterns and textures to show contrast
  • Be careful with contrasting colors and hues
  • Avoid bad color combos
