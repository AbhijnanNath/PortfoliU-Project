## Why should you care?

Everybody uses the internet and each of them are different! It's unlikely that you will know every user so creating a website that some can't use is annoying to them and detrimental to your websites growth. Having more users will help to expand the site's reach and increases the likelyhood of gaining more users in the future.

## Who does this affect?

The short answer is everybody! Ensuring that colors are easy to see and read is important for everyone but especially people who have color blindness or other impairments.

## What is color blindess?

Color blindness is a medical condition where an individual can't see colors in a normal way. However, there are a few different forms of color blindness. The most common version of color blindness is the inability to distinguish between different shades of red and green. Another type of color blindness has difficulty between blue and yellow, and a third type of color blindness leaves the individual with no color perception -- everything they see is in greyscale. 
This condition is passed genetically, but it can also develop from traumatic injury to your eyes or brain. If passed genetically, there is no treatment for it. Usually, this condition is more seen in men as compared to women.

## How to be proactive and work towards a more accessible web
Designing for accessibility doesn’t mean that the aesthetic integrity of your design needs to suffer. With that in mind, here are the some elements that should be focused on for a colorblind-friendly UX:
  * Use both colors and symbols
  * Keep it minimal
  * Use patterns and textures to show contrast
  * Pay careful attention to contrasting colors and hues
  * Avoid bad color combos; overlaying colours on opposite ends of the colour wheel makes it easier to read
  * Have clear text descriptions accompanying images
  * Don't only use color to convey information i.e use different font styles
  
## Common pitfalls
Like fonts, Colors are important for making a user feel at ease when they enter a website and serve as an eye-catching layout to draw their attention to the content.Because of this, web designers must use them both appropriately and creatively without jeopardizing the website's text legibility.A poorly designed color scheme can have unexpected problems that hinder the UX of your B2B website and drive visitors away. Here are some of the Common mistake which Developer does:
   • Colors are too vibrant/too neutral
   • Excessive usage of Neon Colors
   • Using too many colors at once (Rainbow Patterns)
   • Black/white minimalism may be tempting, but use it with moderation.
