# Markdown

Markdown was designed to be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions (like HTML). It is a markup language commonly used for writing simple formatted documents without needing to use a GUI to format text, such as using **bold** and *italics*. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format.

Markdown is an important language for developers to master because of it's use across applications (GitHub, Slack, Notion, etc.).
