Lastly, if a maintainer asks you to 'rebase' your PR, they're saying there's a lot of code that's been changed and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting Started
* Create your own branch of the code
* Do the changes on your branch
* If you like the change and you think the project can use it:
   * Be sure you have commit messages that are clear and concise.
   * Be sure you followed the code of conduct and ground rules.
   * Create a PR indicating you'd like to your changes to be considered for the project.

# Bugs, Features, Enhancements
This is a new open-source project and we are in the process of creating issue templates for bugs, features, and enhancements.

In general:
* For bugs, please include:
   * A step by step of what you did
   * What you saw vs expected to happen

* For enhancements / features:
    * PortfoliU Project's goal is to have useful templates and resources. If you find yourself using another free open source template or other resources that you think the community would like or benefit from, please feel free to create an issue.
    * Describe the feature/enhancement you would like to see
    * Why you need/want that feature/enhancement
    * How that feature/enhancement should work or be added

# Code Review Process
At this time, the core team is minimal and are current students. This being said, PRs are typically reviewed and given feedback weekly. After feedback is return, we expect responses within a month. After a month, we may close the PR, given it isn't showing any additional activity.
